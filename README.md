Gaussian models and evaluation of clusters

For the sample model of distinguishing numbers, different clustering models are used
and the most suitable dividing point (number of clusters) and the suitable covariance
matrix structure are found. Choose a suitable Gaussian model and use four methods to
explore whether the clustering can be successfully divided or which ones are
classified into one category. According to sample analysis, it may be difficult to
successfully use clustering to make detailed divisions, or the accuracy may be
relatively low. Explore the impact of matrix selection or model changes on sample
analysis.
